# Seattle Broadband Speeds Study
A study on Seattle's broadband speed data

Knowing if an ISP is giving us the speeds we deserve is simple. We just need to answer these 3 questions:
**What and how much are people paying for?**<br>
**What do these ISPs say they're offering?**<br>
**What do we get for what we pay for?**<br>
